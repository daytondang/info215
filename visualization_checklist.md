|   1  	| **Graph type is appropriate** <br> Graph should highlight the relationship of the data. It needs to make such relationship obvious following a quick look and analysis.                                                                                                         	|   	|   	|   	|     	|
|   2  	| **Simple visualization is better than complicated visualization** <br> Simple but containing the same information density as the more complicated one is always better. Note: certain plot types are the convention for certain domains despite being complicated thus okay.    	|   	|   	|   	|     	|
|   3  	| **Visualizations tell a story** <br> All the visualizations must be able to weave a story.                                                                                                                                                                                      	|   	|   	|   	|     	|
|   4  	| **Scale should not be misleading** <br> Show the full range of data to ensure the observer gets the right perspective and context of the data.                                                                                                                                  	|   	|   	|   	|     	|
|   5  	| **Data arrangement is intentional** <br> Arrange data on the graph in ways that can highlight patterns (i.e. order from highest to lowest).                                                                                                                                     	|   	|   	|   	|     	|
|   6  	| **Check title, axis labels, tick mark density and labels, and legend** <br> Appropriate title, axes are labeled properly with correct unit(s), tick mark density is not too many or too few for the plot type. Text size is large enough but not too large to clutter the plot. 	|   	|   	|   	|     	|
|   7  	| **Keep the number of colors to a minimum** <br> Colors should be consistent across multiple plots using the same variables; when the difference is already highlighted by other plot feature (i.e. length of bar), only use one single color (for the bar).                     	|   	|   	|   	|     	|
|   8  	| **Annotate when appropriate** <b> Annotate on the graph where the observer is expected to pay attention to (i.e. maximum values).                                                                                                                                               	|   	|   	|   	|     	|
|   9  	| **Avoid chart junk** <br> Eliminate chart junk (i.e. border of graph), maintain high data-to-ink ratio (i.e. line > area > volume), remove or mute unnecessary grid lines.                                                                                                      	|   	|   	|   	|     	|
|  10  	| **If possible, make visualization interactive** <br> Interactive visualization is more powerful as it allows extra exploration.                                                                                                                                                 	|   	|   	|   	|     	|
